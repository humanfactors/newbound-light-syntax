There aren’t enough legible, intentionally designed light syntax themes for text editors.

**newbound** is a light theme for [Atom](https://atom.io), based on the hues and shades from [Oliver Pattison’s website](https://olivermak.es). Optimized for writing markdown and front-end development, it should also work for general use.

## Features

- Moderately high contrast without any harsh color pairings
- Consistent support for syntax grammar across languages
- Carefully selected, [Base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16)-inspired palette
- Support for UIs that are responsive to hues from syntax themes, like the built-in [One Light UI theme](https://github.com/atom/one-light-ui)
- Subtle `invisibles` (if enabled in Settings)
- Suitable for monospace fonts without an italic variant

## Specific support for these syntaxes

- HTML
- (GitHub-flavored) Markdown
- Liquid
- CSS
- SCSS/Sass
- Less
- JavaScript
- JSON
- YAML
- Ruby

General support for other languages is intended but not guaranteed. I have done brief testing of syntax highlighting for other languages.

**newbound** is especially friendly toward [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) development, particularly if used with [liquid-language](https://atom.io/packages/language-liquid) support (not built-in).
