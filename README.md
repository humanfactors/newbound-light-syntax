# newbound light syntax theme for Atom

## (work in progress – will be stable at 1.0)

A legible, light theme for [Atom](https://atom.io), based on the hues and shades from [my website](https://olivermak.es). Optimized for writing markdown and front-end code.

## Features

- Moderately high contrast without any harsh color pairings
- Consistent support for syntax grammar across languages
- Carefully selected, [Base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16)-inspired palette
- Support for UIs that are responsive to hues from syntax themes, like the built-in [One Light UI theme](https://github.com/atom/one-light-ui)
- Subtle `invisibles` (if enabled in Settings)
- Suitable for monospace fonts without an italic variant

## Specific support for these syntaxes

- HTML
- Markdown
- Liquid
- CSS
- SCSS/Sass
- Less
- JavaScript
- JSON
- YAML
- Ruby
